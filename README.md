# One-Day-Challenge / Power-BI
A one-day challenge involving providing meaningful insights, analyzing various metrics, and utilizing advanced Power BI features.

As part of a challenge organized by the Henry Academy, two teams competed to create the most comprehensive and insightful dashboard using Power BI. I was part of the winning team, where we focused on delivering clear and interactive reports based on customer data.

The primary objective of the challenge was to provide meaningful insights into the client base, analyzing various metrics such as total clients, average annual income, average age, family structure, homeownership, and gender distribution. We used advanced Power BI features to craft these reports, ensuring data accuracy and relevance.

In the first dashboard, we visualized key client metrics, including occupation, total children by educational level, and a breakdown by gender and marital status. The second dashboard expanded on the first, focusing on client income distribution across different ranges.

Our team had the opportunity to present our work live in front of the event organizers, where we demonstrated the interactivity and insights provided by our dashboards. As a result of our performance and the high quality of our project, we were recognized on LinkedIn for our achievement.

The win in this challenge showcased not only our technical skills in data analysis and visualization but also our ability to work collaboratively and present our findings clearly under time constraints.
